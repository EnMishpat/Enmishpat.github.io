# Enmishpat.github.io
Creating a github page for my Wake Tech class. 
I realy like to learn new and fun things. 
I like to tie knots.
If you have any questions for me please feel free to ask. 

My name is Zachary Fontaine and my email is zgfontaine@my.waketech.edu
My github account is here to help me learn HTML and collaborate with my fellow developers
I created this new repository as an assigment for my class. 
In order to clone my repository to my machine, I open the GitHub Desktop app, on the main screen after loging in there was a list of my repositorys from github.com. I selected Enmishat.github.io and selected "clone repository". The app made it easy to do.
